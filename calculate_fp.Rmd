We need to do a few things. Limit each player to 16 weeks only of data. And it must be exactly 16 weeks of data.

That should give us 18 observations per player/season. 

Week 30 is keeper (1 = yes, 2 = no)
Week 40 is draft_value
Weeks 1-16 are points scored.

Need to decide if I want to only model drafted players. I think the answer is yes.
