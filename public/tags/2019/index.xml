      <description>Over on the redesigned message board Tim asks:
 Can I get some kind of stats corner research to see if Darnold just posted the worst game in the history of this league? And also has a 2 QB team ever ended up with less points than the 0.1 wentz and Darnold combined for? I’ll hang up and listen
 Great question!
This is both easy and hard to answer.</description>
