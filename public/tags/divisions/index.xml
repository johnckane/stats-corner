 Hey John, have we ever had such a strong division in the league? With Ken, Matt, and I sitting at 21-6 overall, I was wondering if that is heading towards the best division winning percentage ever?
 Good question James. Over a week has passed since McShane asked that question, and the teams in the division went 1-2 in Week 10 so they now sit at 22-8, good for a 0.</description>
