      <description>Welcome back to Stats Corner for the 2015 Season!
This place has a new look, a new location on the internet and new ideas. I will no longer be restricted to message board posts. Bear with me as the style evolves. Here in Week 1 I want to focus on content and content only. Future posts should have a better style.
Scoring the Draft Coming out of Draft Day I’m sure most of you were feeling pretty good.</description>
