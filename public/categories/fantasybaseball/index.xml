      <description>This year for the first time in our fantasy baseball league history we included an obligatory buy-in. The stakes were low, only $25 per team. To increase season-long engagement we made quarterly payouts of $25 to the team with the best record that quarter. The final payouts were $50 to the runner-up and $100 to the champion.
This is how it played out:
 Q1 Winner - Matovina Q2 Winner - Olson Q3 Winner - Thieneman Q4 Winner - Harrington</description>
