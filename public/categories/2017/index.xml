      <description>For the first six or so years in the league we defaulted to however ESPN thought best with the schedule.

      <description>Welcome back to Stats Corner posts for the 2017 season! Better late than never. This is the first post on a new platform, as you can see. I have purchased the domain www.statscorner.com.
I’ve gone back and incorporated posts from previous years dating back to 2014. You can find through the home page. Links to both the Advanced Standings and Record Book appear on the left hand side. So if nothing else statscorner.</description>
