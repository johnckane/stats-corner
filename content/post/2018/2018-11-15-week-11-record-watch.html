<p>Another week, another check-in on potential records being set. The post last week successfully jinxed Hartman as he lost for the first time. My playoff and BYE probabilities are again calculable.</p>

<p>Hartman still comfortably ahead. Both Dâ€™Skae and Harrington also remain on the board, separated by a mere 3.2 points.</p>

<p>The gap is narrowing here but Hartman still has a comfortable lead through 10 weeks of play. Harrington also makes an appearance.</p>

<div id="unluck" class="section level2">

<p>Harrington still about as unlucky as 2012 Higdon through 10 weeks. But he would have to suffer some bad losses the rest of the way to claim this ignoble crown.</p>
