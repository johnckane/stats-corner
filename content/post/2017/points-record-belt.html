<p>Welcome back to Stats Corner posts for the 2017 season! Better late than never. This is the first post on a new platform, as you can see. I have purchased the domain <a href="www.statscorner.com" class="uri">www.statscorner.com</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve gone back and incorporated posts from previous years dating back to 2014. You can find through the home page. Links to both the <a href="http://ec2-54-213-112-234.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3838/stats-corner/advanced-standings/">Advanced Standings</a> and <a href="http://ec2-54-213-112-234.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3838/stats-corner/record-book/">Record Book</a> appear on the left hand side. So if nothing else <a href="www.statscorner.com">statscorner.com</a> is an easy url to remember if only to bring you up to date on Proportional Wins.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>The career home run record is arguably the holy grail of sports records. There is something very pure to it. We all know Babe Ruth’s 714 home runs, then Hank Aaron at 755 and (some of us know) Barry Bonds at 763. Ruth became the career home run leader when he hit his 138th career home run in 1920 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_progressive_career_home_runs_leaders">(source)</a>. He held onto the record for over 50 years before Aaron broke it. Then Aaron held the claim on the record for 30 plus years before Bonds broke his record.</p>
<p>The natural comparison here is our single game points record. Of all the records I track I think it is my favorite, even though I’ve never really sniffed it. How long do teams usually hold on to the record?</p>

<h2>Who’s (Been) Number 1?</h2>
<p>Below is the first gif in Stats Corner history, which illustrates the top 10 single game points record at every week since the league’s inception.</p>

<p>What about time at #1? Between Losman’s Gamblers, Cameron’s Cuties and 12.5 PSI, who’s held the belt the longest? Here the chronological list:</p>

<p>Since this includes playoffs, RJ needs to hold onto this record through Week 7 of next season to dethrone Losman’s Gamblers for time spent at number 1.</p>
