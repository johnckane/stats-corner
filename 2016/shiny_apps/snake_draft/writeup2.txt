Based on intuition you already have. 

E.g. quarterbacks are rarely chosen in the first few rounds because there isn't 
as much differentiation at the top of the pool.

We all operate with that understanding but don't quantify it.

How easily does your draft strategy have a wrench thrown in it? If someone goes
off the board earlier than you expected (bad!) or is still available when you're
selecting (good!) how can you adapt your later round strategies. Can you do so 
on the fly?

Do you consider BYE weeks for the players. Often during the draft I resign 
myself to saying, "OK I'll just throw in the towel for Week 7 and Week 11. I'll
still go 11-2." That thinking is delusional.

I say you need to attempt to win every week!

To do so depends on the particulars of your league, but Matthew Berry /has 
/written /over and /over about getting to 100 points each week.

That's where my Shiny App can help. It requires some attention but what it does 
is:
1) Evaluates all current available players
2) Considers average draft position and which players are likely to still be 
around the NEXT time you select* and calculates the drop in points from the 
players available now to who is likely there the next time. 
3) Recommends players based on the Value Add to your team relative to everyone 
else available now and who would be available next time.

In addition:
1) Seeks to optimize every game's point totals, not just season totals.

It does this by factoring


It requires
1) Initial draft (your pick #) and league (# of starters by position) setup
2) Entering players as they get drafted by the rest of your league in general,
and by your team specifically.

After that, the recommendations take care of themselves. 

This tools provides information in real time as you draft.
