The current working version is version 2.5

This makes reccomendations based on value added to your roster on a per game
basis, rather than points scored.

Version 2.3 has recommendations based on points scored.

Things to think about:
1) Should we even have BYE week and position filters?
2) Do we need to list the positions to rec?
3) The UI could be simplified
4) How about a theme/logo?
