The current working version is version 2.3
The development version is version 2.5

Version 2.4 does what I want, but is really slow. 



The idea for the development version will be to make reccomendations based
on value added, rather than tack that on to recomendations based on point 
dropoffs. This will incorporate "BYE" weeks into the draft strategy.
