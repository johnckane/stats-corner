Introducing the Stats Corner NFL Snake Draft Assistant! 


This application recommends selections based on how much value they add to your
team relative to the players likely to be available

It does this by analyzing:
1) Predicted points per game
2) Your roster
3) Average draft position.

Or, continue reading about the analytical details below.

### Predicted Points Per Game
This metric is the most straightforward. Many websites produce preseason 
forecasts of player PPG, the site FantasyFootballAnalytics aggregates those
predictions and produces a weighted average that historically has been
the most accurate.

I subscribe to the site, downloaded the data and loaded into the app.


### Your Roster

Roster analysis consists of three components: 1. your roster settings,
2. your current roster, and the BYE weeks of your current roster

###### Roster Settings
Before you draft, you input the position limits in your starting lineup. 
For example: 1 QB, 2 RBs, 2 WRs, 1 TE, 1 FLEX, 1 DST and 1 K. The app can handle
leagues with either FLEX (RB/WR/TE) or OP (QB/RB/WR/TE) positions. 

###### Your current roster 
As you draft players and input them into the app
a weekly starting lineup is assembled and the expected number of points scored
each week is calculated. 

###### Taking BYE weeks into account
When a player has a BYE, of course they don't play. When your team amasses 
multiple BYEs in a given week, you'll be stretched thin and likely lose. 
These recommendations take BYE weeks into account and will elevate players
who do not have overlapping BYEs with players at the same position. 

### Average Draft Position
The players that are recommended have their Value Added to your roster 
calculated. This accounts for your current team as well when their BYE weeks
fall. 

To make recomendations, the app compares the Value Added by each player against
who is likely to remain in the draft pool the next time you pick (based on your
order in the draft sequence). 

By position the player with the highest difference between available now and 
best player available next time around will be recommended.

The players are ranked according to the difference in Value Added between now
and the next time you make a selection.
